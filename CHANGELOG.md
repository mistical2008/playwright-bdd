# Changelog

## dev

* **possibly breaking:** Introduce `featuresRoot` option to have more control of generated files structure [#44](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/44).

  This fix actually reverts simplification of `outputDir` by common parent (added in v5, see [#40](https://github.com/vitalets/playwright-bdd/issues/40)).

  *❤️ I need to admit that automatic simplification of `outputDir` structure was not the right choice. Playwright heavily relies on tests structure for storing screenshots and we should keep it as stable as possible. I don't like such reverting but better to do it now than later. Introduced `featuresRoot` allows to control output structure the same way as TypeScript controls it with [rootDir](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDir).*

  *If you use screenshots/snapshots you may need to re-save them to new paths after upgrading.*
